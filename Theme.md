# Theme
When I think of the Dreadful Tower, I think of a tall building right? But it isn't just another tall building that you see in your city but rather it is a place that you want to escape from because it is horrible. I think one of the main focuses is making the player feel like a prison escapee, trying to leave this place from the rooftop of the tower. There was a lot of questions that needed to be solved when it came to finding the theme and finalize what I want for this level.

## Where is this place in the world?
Without saying much of anything, I want this tower to be taken place in hell, as it fits with the enemies that will be encountered throughout this level. It also goes well with all the weapons, textures, and theme with the level called Dreadful Tower. 

## What happened here recently?
Attempted Prison Escape, where you as the player, finds the potential chance to leave this tower. Then again no one has ever tried to do anything like that in Hell. 

## What should the player be on the lookout for?
The way to escape is to reach the top, so there will be security doors and requirments to reach a path needed to move to the next floor of the tower.

## What here is powerful or valuable?
Your weapons that you can collect are powerful and needed, and there are ways to gain access to some of the better weapons, as well as ways to collect ammo other then small batches across the map.

## Whoâ€™s really in control here?
Security of the Dreadful Tower are in charge here of the building, they are the one that have you there, they live in hell, they control everything even your fate.

## What rooms do this area normally contain? 
These areas would usually contain rooms you can explore, with stuff to explore rooms, with rewards for players for exploring. As well as consequences such as enemies.

## How do people interact with this location before the player arrives?
There will be security walking around guarding the place, although there would have been little interaction since you'd be the first person to ever try it in the Dreadful Tower.

## How does it connect to other spaces? 
The Tower is multiple areas with rooms that are all connected through ways of traversing to the next floors, such as elevators and staircases. 

## What is its architectural style? 
I want to go with a Steampunk/Dieselpunk style of architexture to the likes of hopefully Bioshock and Final Fantasy 7. These worlds are so cool and interesting to me, I love those styles so much and the WADS I have could potentially help with achieveing that style well.

One of the Wads with a lot of the core textures I am looking for.
