When I think of the Dreadful Tower, I think of a tall building right? But it isn't just another tall building that you see in your city but rather it is a place that you want to escape from because it is horrible. I think one of the main focuses is making the player feel like a prison escapee, trying to leave this place from the rooftop of the tower.
